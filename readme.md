A Pokemon randomizer I'm creating as a fun side project!

- Currently focuses on Gen III, but I plan to support at least Gen IV and Gen II
- Heavy focus on PCG and Vanilla+ options

Originally based off of source code from Artemis251's Pokemon Emerald Randomizer (v.2.2 -- 13 April 2014) but I pivoted to C# so now its just a reference.
Check out their website! http://artemis251.fobby.net/downloads/emerald/

Another project that's been a great reference for writing this is dabomstew's Universal pokemon randomizer.

I don't have an executable release yet, but I'll link one here when I do.
