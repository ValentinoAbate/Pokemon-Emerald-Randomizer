An Emerald randomizer I'm customizing as a fun side project!

Based off of original code by Artemis251: v.2.2 -- 13 April 2014

Plans:

This randomizer is great, but the randomization is a little too game-breaking to do Nuzlocke runs in. 

My first orders of business are:

	-add some balancing constraints to the randomization:
		-basic pokemon -> basic pokemon (maintain evolution stage)
		-Pokemon with random type learn moves of their type more often
		-Move rareness weighting (Hydro cannon is rarer than splash, etc.)
		-Type weighting (Dragon is rarer than grass, etc.)
	-make the crazy randomness ("mutations") rarer but break the above rules
		-settable percentages and weightings
