This is not a complete list, and will be updated as I think of things and transcribe my notes from other places

IDEAS:
- Make trainer smeargles have random movesets or premade fun ones
- Randomize unknown's base stats
- Add some ??? type attack moves to the game
- Make gym leader TM based on type and make sure their pokemon know it (if applicable)
- Champion randomization (the champion could be Brendan/May, wally, or any other reoccuring / special trainer in the game or that is added)
- Extra reoccuring trainers (you might encounter youngster joey multiple times throughout the game, etc)
- Smeargle Hell: A certain percentage of moves have their effects replaced with sketch
- Ability-based synergies for smart moveset generation (get sunny day if you have chlorophil, etc)

FEATURES:
- Settings preset saving (possibly in JSON or XML)
- Item randomization (field items)

FIXES:
- Pokemon that evolve with stones have bad default movesets due to not learning stuff by level up.
	- Still an issue, but fixed in smart moveset generation. Currently no fix for default movesets
- Expanding the movesets (probably just repointing the pokemon data table) and expanding the move data table (probably just repointing the move data table) causes softlocks on battle start in the output ROM
	- Pretty sure I fixed this by ensuring data written in free space always gets written at an address divisible by 4.
- Some pokemon can't learn any TMs, even with full compatibility on
