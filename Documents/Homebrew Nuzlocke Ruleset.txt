Base Rules:
- If a pokemon faints in battle, it is considered dead. It must be either released or put in a special PC box
- You must nickname all of your pokemon
- You can only catch the first pokemon you run into on any route. If you kill or fail to catch it, you may not catch a pokemon on this route.
	- You may, however catch any shiny pokemon (except the red gyarados in SG/HGSS).
Optional Difficulty Rules:
- A black/whiteout is considered a player death, and ends the run.
- No items in battle
- You must play on set
- Unless randomized, you must release your starter if it goes above level 10.
- You can only use each full heal once (pokecenters, etc)
- You cannot use the EXP Share or the Lucky Egg (if given to you by an event)
- You cannot use any static pokemon given to you
- You must make any static pokemon you encounter faint (including legendaries)
Optional QOL rules:
- No Wild Starters: Starters encountered in the wild may not be caught, but also do not count as your pokemon for the route
- Dupes Clause: If you run into a pokemon you currently have, you may skip it. You may skip an amount of that pokemon equal to the number you have alive.
Optional Flavor Rules:
- You must name your player character your preferred name
