This is not a complete list, and will be updated as I think of things and transcribe my notes from other places

IDEAS:
- Make trainer smeargles have random movesets or premade fun ones
- Make unknown the ??? type instead of psychic
- Randomize unknown's base stats
- Add some ??? type attack moves to the game
- Make gym leader TM based on type and make sure their pokemon know it (if applicable)
- Champion randomization (the champion could be Brendan/May, wally, or any other reoccuring / special trainer in the game or that is added)
- Extra reoccuring trainers (you might encounter youngster joey multiple times throughout the game, etc)

FIXES:
- pokemon that evolve with stones have bad default movesets due to not learning stuff by level up.
